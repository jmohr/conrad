# A simple ODBC ORM for Python

Welcome to Conrad, a simple ORM for ODBC databases. Conrad was specifically
designed for connecting to legacy ODBC databases. With it, you can quickly
create an adapter for most ODBC drivers -- even the old, esoteric ones. From
there, it can introspect the database structure, and give you quick access
to all of the golden ORM goodness you need for your project.

Conrad was inspired by ORMs such as Autumn and Storm. If you are looking
for a more full featured, traditional ORM for Python, these are both good
options. If you have an existing legacy ODBC database, and you're looking
to easily integrate an ORM solution, Conrad might be just what you need.
